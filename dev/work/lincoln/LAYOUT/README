This directory contains the source files necessary to make
the VALID "layout" program.  This program is run by the logic
designer who, after making and compiling a logic drawing, now
wishes to graphically layout the devices (DIPs etc.) on a wirewrap
board (e.g augat uwg12a).  This program will produce a graphics
editor file which will (when "ged" is invoked) place all of the
devices used be the designer around the perimeter of the board so
that (s)he merely needs to use the mouse to place them on the board.

This program currently supports two wirewrap board geometries,
the AUGAT UWG12, and the AUGAT HPWG12.  The only board dependant
information needed by the program is the physical length and width
of the board, and the physical x/y offset from the lower left corner
of the board to pin one of the board (all in 1000ths of an inch).
To add a new board geometry, this information (along with the name of
the board) must be entered into the "bgeomtbl" in the file "bgeom.c".
The simplest way to do this, is to clone one of the existing entries
and change the numbers appropriatly.
