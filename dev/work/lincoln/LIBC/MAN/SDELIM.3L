.SH DESCRIPTION
Given a string \fIstr\fP, and an opening and closing delimiter
string \fIopen\fP and \fIclose\fP, this function will copy the portion
of the string which lies between the delimiters into the target
string.  The target is assumed to have enough space allocated to
hold the characters between the delimiters plus an EOS character.
If either of the delimiters is not found, or the opening one is
after the closing one, then NULL is returned, otherwise a pointer
to the target is returned.
