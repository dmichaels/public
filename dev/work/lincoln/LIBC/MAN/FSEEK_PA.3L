.TH FSEEK_PAT 3L LOCAL

.SH NAME
fseek_pat - seek to a pattern in a file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft B
long
.br
fseek_pat(f, pat)
.br
FILE *f;
.br
char *pat;
.ft P

.SH DESCRIPTION
Sets the IO pointer of file \fIf\fP to the position of the next
occurrence of the pattern string \fIpat\fP.  If the pattern is
found, then the old file offset is returned.
.PP
If the pattern is not found,
then the IO pointer will be left intact, and -1 will be returned.
.PP
If the pattern is found,
the IO pointer will be set to the last character in the pattern
string.  That is, the next \fIgetc(f)\fP will yield the character
immediately following the last character of the chosen pattern string.

.SH WARNINGS
This function coordinates with the buffering used by the
standard C input/output library, and should only be used
in conjunction with other functions within the library
(e.g. use \fIfseek(3S)\fP rather than \fIlseek(2)\fP).
