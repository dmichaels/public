<ins>**Lycos, Waltham, MA |** 8 years 5 months</ins> <br />
Lead engineer for Lycos Entertainment. Implemented apps to retrieve data from partners (movies, showtimes, theaters, celebrities, musicians, books, news), parse/transform, store in database (SQL Server). Created re-usable package of COM objects allowing such feeds to be created via XML config. Implemented HTTP/XML based API handling front-end queries (with full text search), retrieving/merging data from a variety of sources; and zipcode/location mapping service (for theaters/showtimes). Implemented a reference UI using these APIs for testing and guiding UI team. Development in VBScript, ASP, XSLT, C++.

Worked on development of apps aggregating search across a number of dating sites. Developed an extensible, multi-threaded service in C# collecting disparate data from partner feeds to to database (Oracle); ported to run on Linux using Mono. Integration with FAST search technology.

Built downloadable Internet Explorer plugin &quot;search assistant&quot; app, implemented in C++ as Browser Helper Object and Explorer Bar COM objects, its function controlled by remotely fetched XML config. Supported automatic silent updates. Over ten million downloads/installs; providing significant revenue stream. Built Web based real-time reporting system with UI/dashboard tracking downloads, installs, upgrades, uninstalls.

Implemented .NET based engine for rapid development of Web services to with the retrieve, merge, and transform data from a variety of sources (database, HTTP, filesystem), using XML/XSLT config.

Implemented an editorial tool used to evaluate results for specialized search product using C# and ASP.NET. Contributed to some search engine/service work. Experimented with Lucene.NET.

Helped transition *My Lycos* to more flexible, scalable HTTP/XML (SOAP-like) architecture. Developed COM components in C++ supporting multi-threaded asynchronous HTTP fetches to reduce page latency and improve throughput. Implemented Web diagnostic dashboards/UIs, APIs, to monitor performance. Created COM components in C++ retrieving data from various feeds/APIs (weather, stocks, sports, etc). Built the framework for much of *My Lycos* Web front-end used to generate the personalized pages, mostly in ASP.

<ins>**Intersolv, Framingham, MA |** 1 year 3 months</ins> <br />
