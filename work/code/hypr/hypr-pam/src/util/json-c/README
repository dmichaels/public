This directory contains the salient parts of the json-c source from its GitHub repo,
https://github.com/json-c/json-c.git, copied directly into our own hypr-pam source
directory (hypr-pam/src/util/json-c) for direct compilation and linking into
our hypr-pam shared library (pam_hypr.so); and for direct check-in into our
own hypr-pam GitHub repo: https://g.hypr.com/david.michaels/hypr-pam
Copy done via: hypr-pam/etc/misc/copy-json-c-source-into-our-project.sh

We do this to eliminate dependency related friction encountered when trying
to use the json-c shared library (libjson-c.so) across Linux variants, with
the various ways to install json-c from various distribution repos, and/or
with the various versions of json-c installed or already present.

Yes, this process will bypass the json-c build process with all its feature
checks and header build process and so on, but it will almost certainly be fine.
And not using a shared library also technically misses out on updates/fixes,
et cetera, but our usage of this library is very simple/basic; we could
almost to the JSON parsing ourselves; which would be another option too.

Another option is/was to build json-c from its source as a static library and
link to that, but then that would need to be run as part of the build on each
platform, and that can come with its own complications; there is a script to
do that if desired here: hypr-pam/etc/misc/install-json-c-from-source.sh.
