This directory contains the source files necessary to make
the VALID "wirelist" program.  This program is run by the logic
designer who, after making and compiling a logic drawing, and a
physical layout drawing (done with the help of "layout") now wishes
to create a wirelist file which will be suitable to input to the
Group 72 wirewrap system, which perform the actual wiring of the
board.  Along with the wirelist file (board_name.lst), a number of
reference/error files are produced.

This program currently supports two wirewrap board geometries,
the AUGAT UWG12, and the AUGAT HPWG12.  To add another board
geometry, you must write a number of geometry dependant routines,
and put them in a file in a sub-directory of the "boards" directory.
The simplest way to do this, is to clone the routines for one of the
boards listed above, and modify them as necessary.  Also, an entry
for the new board must be made in the "bgeom.c" file; again, just
follow the example of existing geometries.
