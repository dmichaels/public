.TH FSEEK_NPAT 3L LOCAL

.SH NAME
fseek_npat - seek to a choice of patterns in a file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft B
fseek_npat(f, pat_list, npat)
.br
FILE *f;
.br
char *pat_list[];
.br
int npat;
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
Sets the IO pointer of file \fIf\fP to the position of the next
occurrence of any of the \fInpat\fP pattern strings in the string
array \fIpat_list\fP,
and returns an index to the found pattern into the \fIpat_list\fP string array.
.PP
If none of the patterns are found,
then the IO pointer will be left intact, and -1 will be returned.
.PP
If a pattern is found,
the IO pointer will be set to the last character in the pattern
string.  That is, the next \fIgetc(f)\fP will yield the character
immediately following the last character of the chosen pattern string.

.SH WARNINGS
This function coordinates with the buffering used by the
standard C input/output library, and should only be used
in conjunction with other functions within the library
(e.g. use \fIfseek(3S)\fP rather than \fIlseek(2)\fP).
