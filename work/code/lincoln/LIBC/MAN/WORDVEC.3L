.SH DESCRIPTION
Constructs a word vector consisting of words in the given string
\fIstr\fP delimited by characters in the character set \fIdelim\fP.
Pointers to the beginning of each word are placed in order in the
character pointer array \fIvec\fP.  Return the number of words actually
put into the vector.

.SH WARNINGS
The string \fIstr\fP is munged since end of string (EOS) characters
actually replace the delimiter characters;
it should be considered totally lost.
If the caller wants to save the contents the string \fIstr\fP, (s)he
should copy it to a buffer before making this call.

.SH NOTES
The character pointer array \fIvec\fP is assumed to have
at least \fInword\fP elements allocated for its use.
