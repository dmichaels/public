.TH GETLINE 3L LOCAL

.SH NAME
getline - read a non-trivial line from a file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft B
char *
.br
getline(line, maxline, f)
.br
char *line;
.br
int maxline;
.br
FILE *f;
.ft P

.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads \fImaxline\fP - 1 characters, or up to a newline, whichever
comes first, from the given file \fIf\fP into the string \fIline\fP
after first skipping any leading blanks in the input stream
(i.e. blanks, tabs, and newlines ala \fIisspace/ctype(3)\fP).
The last character
read into \fIline\fP is followed by NULL character.
The newline
is \fInot\fP included in the string.
The IO pointer is set to the
beginning of the next line (or to EOF if there is no next line. 
Returns the \fIline\fP pointer or NULL upon EOF, or error.

.SH NOTES
This is exactly like \fIfgets()\fP except that leading white-space
is skipped, the newline is not kept, and we skip to the beginning
of the next line in the file after a line is read.
.PP
If \fImaxline\fP = 1, then blanks will be skipped but no characters
will be read (actually one non-white character will be read, and
will then be pushed back onto the stream using \fIungetc(3S)\fP).
