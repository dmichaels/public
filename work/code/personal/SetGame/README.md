<img src="https://github.com/dmichaels/public/blob/master/work/code/personal/SetGame/SetGame.png" alt="drawing" width="300" align="left" /> My first foray into iOS/Swift development. <br />

An iOS app implementation [SET GameÂ®](https://www.setgame.com/set/puzzle).
Instructions **[here](https://www.setgame.com/sites/default/files/instructions/SET%20INSTRUCTIONS%20-%20ENGLISH.pdf)**. <br />
Source code free for the taking. <br /><br />
N.B. Attempting to make available on the Apple App Store would be a violation of the <a href="http://setgame.com/terms-and-conditions">SET Game copyright</a>!
And they'd actually call out any <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~treuille/resc/set/set-letter.pdf">copyright infringement</a>.
