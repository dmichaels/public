The packages in the 'repos' sub-directory were all built from this repo:

  https://g.hypr.com/david.michaels/hypr-pam

using the script:

  hypr-pam/etc/packaging/build.sh

The resultant RPM file is signed using the (GPG) public-key contained here:

  hypr-pam/etc/keys/hypr-pam-public-key.pem

Before building this key should be imported like this:

  sudo rpm --import hypr-pam-public-key.pem

Check the integrity of the resultant RPM file like this:

  rpm --checksig hypr-pam-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm

FYI: There is public (GPG) key already generated in:

  hypr-pam/etc/keys/hypr-pam-public-key.pem 

And its associated private (GPG) key is, for HYPR use, in 1Password7 in the Dev-Engineering space:

  1Password7: Dev-Engineering/hypr-pam-public-key.pem
